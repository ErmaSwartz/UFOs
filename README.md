# UFOs
### Overview of the Project 
##### The purpose of the project was to sort through many years of reported UFO sightings and to organize and display the information in an easily accesible and understandable way. 
### Results 
##### To use the search criteria someone simply needs to type into the provided space one or all of the criteria and hit enter. Any combination of inputs should work, and it is totally okay to leave some blank. Once you have inputed the desired perameters, the database will automatically filter the information to find what you are specifically looking for. Below you can see some examples of different combinations of entries.

### Summary 
##### The advantages of this design is that it will be very easy to filter through the data, if you are looking for specific locations, shapes of UFOs, or dates you can use the new site to filter through all of the data and find what you are looking for. The one draw back is that you can't filter for comments, and the design of the webpage could be more visually apealing. Further work on the webpage and the data could easily remedy this. Other than that, I think the presentation and organization of the data is well done.
